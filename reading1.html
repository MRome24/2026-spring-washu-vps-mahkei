        Toph Tucker makes a statement about how good restaurant websites are, and I completely agree with her. Just like
        Toph, before going to any restaurant, I browse their website to check out their menu and the deals they’re
        offering. He also makes a statement about how a restaurant’s website experience can be comparable to the
        real-life experience. I completely agree, as websites often serve as a first impression of companies, products,
        and individuals. Toph also expresses a fear that restaurants will switch to CMS (content management
        systems)-based websites and lose the vibrancy and creativity that come from websites developed and updated
        manually. I agree with this to an extent, as coding your own website gives more freedom and creative control.
